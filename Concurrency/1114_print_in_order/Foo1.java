 Synchronized allows only one thread of execution to access the resource at the same time.
 Semaphore allows up to n (you get to choose n) threads of execution to access the resource at the same time.

 What does the 0 mean when initialize a semaphoreï¼Ÿ
 hat input is the amount of times acquire() can be called before blocking. i.e. Your semaphore initially has 0 permits,
 in which case permits must be released before they may be acquired.

 In short, a semaphore maintains a set of permits (tickets), each acquire() will take a permit (ticket) from
 semaphore, each release() will return back the permit (ticket) back to the semaphore. If permits (tickets) are not
 available, acquire() will block until one is available.
