/*
*LCS Problem Statement: Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
 *  A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.
 *  For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.
* So a string of length n has 2^n different possible subsequences.
*
*It is a classic computer science problem, the basis of diff
* (a file comparison program that outputs the differences between two files),
 * and has applications in bioinformatics.
*
* Examples:
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4.
