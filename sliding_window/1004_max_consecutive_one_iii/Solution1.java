Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
0 <= k <= nums.length

        Sliding window solution

    -  Grow the window by moving right.
    -  Count how many 0s are in the window.
    - If you have more than k zeros, shrink the window from the left.
    - Track the maximum window length where the count of zeros is â‰¤ k.


    ### How to think about Sliding Window problem?
Ask yourself:
- What am I looking for? (e.g., longest subarray with at most k zeros)
- What happens when I expand the window? (move right)
- What condition breaks the rule? (e.g., more than k zeros)
- How do I fix it? (move left until the condition is valid again)
- What do I track? (e.g., current window size)
