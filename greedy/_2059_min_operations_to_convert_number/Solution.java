/**
 * 2059. Minimum Operations to Convert Number
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-convert-number/description/
 *
 * You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing distinct numbers, an integer start, and an integer goal. There is an integer x that is initially set to start, and you want to perform operations on x such that it is converted to goal. You can perform the following operation repeatedly on the number x:
 *
 * If 0 <= x <= 1000, then for any index i in the array (0 <= i < nums.length), you can set x to any of the following:
 *
 * x + nums[i]
 * x - nums[i]
 * x ^ nums[i] (bitwise-XOR)
 * Note that you can use each nums[i] any number of times in any order. Operations that set x to be out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000 are valid, but no more operations can be done afterward.
 *
 * Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert x = start into goal, and -1 if it is not possible.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,4,12], start = 2, goal = 12
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can go from 2 → 14 → 12 with the following 2 operations.
 * - 2 + 12 = 14
 * - 14 - 2 = 12
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,5,7], start = 0, goal = -4
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: We can go from 0 → 3 → -4 with the following 2 operations.
 * - 0 + 3 = 3
 * - 3 - 7 = -4
 * Note that the last operation sets x out of the range 0 <= x <= 1000, which is valid.
 *
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [2,8,16], start = 0, goal = 1
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: There is no way to convert 0 into 1.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * -10^9 <= nums[i], goal <= 10^9
 * 0 <= start <= 1000
 * start != goal
 * All the integers in nums are distinct.
