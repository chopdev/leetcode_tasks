/**
 * 2447. Number of Subarrays With GCD Equal to K
 *
 * Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of subarrays of nums where the greatest common divisor of the subarray's elements is k.
 * A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 * The greatest common divisor of an array is the largest integer that evenly divides all the array elements.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [9,3,1,2,6,3], k = 3
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The subarrays of nums where 3 is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements are:
 * - [9,(3),1,2,6,3]
 * - [9,3,1,2,6,(3)]
 * - [(9,3),1,2,6,3]
 * - [9,3,1,2,(6,3)]
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4], k = 7
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: There are no subarrays of nums where 7 is the greatest common divisor of all the subarray's elements.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
 * 1 <= nums[i], k <= 10^9
