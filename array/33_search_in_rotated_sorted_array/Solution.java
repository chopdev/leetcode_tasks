 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

 Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
 You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
 You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

 Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).

 Example 1:

 Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
 Output: 4

 Example 2:
 Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
 Output: -1


 IMPORTANT HERE
 to ask if we could have duplicates. In task it is mentioned that we not
